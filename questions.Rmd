# Question Responses

```{r respInit,echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
coding <- c("No","Maybe","Yes")
s4 <- s
s4$newprofile <- s$ageAtBeginningofExp <=10
s4 <- s4[!is.na(newprofile),]
s4 <- s4[response>-2,][, response:=factor(response,levels=c(-1,0,1),labels=c("No","Maybe","Yes"))]
s4$id <- 1
```

In this section, we'll first lead with the response distribution for the
different questions and then study any relationships between response
distributions and covariates.

```{r respDist,dependson='respInit'}
r <- s4[,prop.table(table(question,response),1)*100]
kable(r[order(r[,'Yes']),],
      caption='Responses to Questions'
    , table.attr = "style='width:100%;'")

```

It's interesting how the questions' *Yes* responses arrange themselves into 3
groups: the first on its own, the second two with similar *Yes* percents around
48 and the last three with positive responses in the low 60s.
